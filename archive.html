				<p>
				-2 weeks after- <br />
				boi is still salty (not suprised tbh) <br />
				gets confirmed as a comp-sci alternate <br />
				int hope = 10000000; int salt = 10;<br />
				checks district listings to see what alternate he is<br />
				gg definetly not 5th alternate<br />
				looks at other districts and gets salty that their scores are lower than his<br />
				boi simultaneously flexed and got salty at the same time<br />
				basically going to region with 0.0000001% chance to compete in both events while at the same time having to attend an event after Region<br />
				10000000000 IQ play. also explains why he's still Silver /s<br />
